  This paper explores methods for decoding movement intentions from brain signals using Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs). We investigate common signal processing techniques and machine learning models applied to electroencephalography (EEG) data. The goal is to develop a robust system capable of translating neural activity into control signals for assistive devices. Preliminary results show promising accuracy using a combination of feature extraction and support vector machines.

# Results

## Classification Performance

Our movement intention decoding approach achieved promising results across multiple subjects ([@hearst_support_1998]). The Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier demonstrated robust performance in discriminating between different movement types. Figure 2 shows the classification accuracy across different subjects.

## Feature Importance

Analysis of feature importance revealed that temporal features in the alpha and beta frequency bands were most informative for movement decoding. This aligns with established neuroscientific understanding of motor control processes in the brain.

# Discussion

The results demonstrate the feasibility of decoding movement intentions from EEG signals using machine learning approaches. SVMs provide an effective framework for this classification task, particularly when combined with appropriate feature extraction techniques. However, several limitations should be considered:

1. Inter-subject variability remains a significant challenge
2. Real-time implementation requires further optimization
3. The current approach may not generalize well to novel movement types

## Comparison with Previous Work

Our approach builds upon previous BCI research while addressing several key limitations. The performance metrics compare favorably to similar studies in the literature, particularly in terms of classification accuracy and robustness to noise.

# Conclusion

This study demonstrates the potential of machine learning approaches for decoding movement intentions from brain signals. Support Vector Machines combined with appropriate feature extraction techniques provide a promising framework for BCI applications. Future work should focus on:

1. Improving real-time performance
2. Reducing calibration requirements
3. Exploring deep learning approaches for end-to-end movement decoding
4. Testing with individuals who have motor impairments

The findings have important implications for the development of assistive technologies and neural rehabilitation systems.
