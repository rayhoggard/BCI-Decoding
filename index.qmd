  This paper explores methods for decoding movement intentions from brain signals using Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs). We investigate common signal processing techniques and machine learning models applied to electroencephalography (EEG) data. The goal is to develop a robust system capable of translating neural activity into control signals for assistive devices. Preliminary results show promising accuracy using a combination of feature extraction and support vector machines.

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

data = np.random.rand(5)
print(data) # Output the data if needed

plt.figure()
plt.plot(data, marker='o')
